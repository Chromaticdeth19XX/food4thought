  <p>During the school year, 62% of Oklahoma kids rely on free-and-reduced meals to receive proper nutrition;
    many of these students do not have access to adequate nutrition outside of school. In Tulsa, a staggering 84%
    of students rely on free-and-reduced meals. Individual families, as well as <a href="http://bit.ly/2DWxnN4">nonprofits</a>
    could greatly benefit from knowing when and where summer meals programs are available.</p>
